/*Write a query that displays the order ID, account ID, and total dollar

/*Now write a query that again displays order ID, account ID, and total 
dollar amount for each order, but this time sorted first by total dollar amount

/*Compare the results of these two queries above. How are the results different 
when you switch the column you sort on first?
In query #1, all of the orders for each account ID are grouped together, and then 
within each of those groupings, the orders appear from the greatest order amount to
the least. In query #2, since you sorted by the total dollar amount first, the orders 
appear from greatest to least regardless of which account ID they were from. Then they
are sorted by account ID next. (The secondary sorting by account ID is difficult to see here,
since only if there were two orders with equal total dollar amounts would there need to be 
any sorting by account ID.) */
